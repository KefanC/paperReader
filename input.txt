Inspired by software debugging and regression testing techniques,
we propose and develop MODE , an automated neural network
debugging technique powered by state differential analysis and
input selection. It can help identify buggy neurons and measure
their importance to guide the new input sample selection. MODE
can construct high quality training datasets that effectively and
efficiently fix model bugs without introducing new bugs.
